# Whitespace SaaS Landing Page

The **Whitespace SaaS Landing Page** is a responsive landing page I built using a design in **Figma**. This project showcases my ability to translate Figma designs into clean, pixel-perfect HTML using **React, TypeScript, and Vite**.

It demonstrates my **frontend skills** in:

- Responsive design
- Mobile-first development
- Component-based architecture
- Interactive navigation and UI behavior
